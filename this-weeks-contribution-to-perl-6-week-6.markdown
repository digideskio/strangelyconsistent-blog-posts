## This Week's Contribution to Perl 6 Week 6:help improve the sidebars in the book

*(**Update 2010-06-10:** Two days, and already two submissions! I continue to be amazed by the willingness of people to contribute to these weekly challenges. Somehow, the noosphere generosity so prevalent in the open-source world feels much more magical when it's coming from lurkers. Thank you!)*

For this week's contribution to Perl 6, we ask you to wield some LaTeX skills in order to improve the appearance of the book some of us are writing.

[(Introduction to this series of challenges)](http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/contribute-now-announce.html)

## Background

Have a look at page 23 in [the book](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/perl6/book/book-2010-04.pdf). There's a "sidebar" there, but it doesn't go on the side of the page, and it isn't especially aesthetically pleasing.

Help us make it better!

## Submission

Please send your submission to the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, and set me (cmasak@gmail.com) as CC, because the mailing list sometimes has a large delay.

If you have any questions, please ask the mailing list, me or (preferred) on our IRC channel, #perl6.

The best/most extensible/most complete/prettiest/whatever submission will make it into the next release of the book.

I wanted to comment on [Jonathan's excellent Hague grant proposal](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2009/04/hague_perl_6_grant_request_tra.html#more), writing something like this: 

<dl>
<dd>I'd just like to chime in on Moritz' praise of Jonathan. It has been exhilarating to observe all the progress so far. Looking forward to more of the same.</dd>
</dl>

But the comment function is broken, telling me: "Comment Submission Error - Your comment submission failed for the following reasons: Invalid request"

First off: there's nothing invalid about my request. Actually, it's more of an opinion than a request. ☺

Second: it seems that the comment function is broken on perlfoundation. I've emailed [rdice](email:rdiceperlfoundationorg) about it, so it'll hopefully be fixed RSN. In the meantime, I'll post this so I don't forget what I wrote. [**Update:** rdice++ replied quickly, and in helping him debug the issue, I discovered that turning on Javascript for that page resolved the issue. I.e. nothing broken outside of my browser.]

More features in Rakudo!

Oops. I think excessive distractedness just made me miss a 10-day interval, thereby falling off the Iron Man challenge. Oh well. [Sidenote: Is there a way to easily check one's Ironman status?]

Lately, I've been feeling a bit like the snowplows shuffling snow around outside my office window. I have a lot of things I want to blog about, but I've been pushing them ahead of me. That's exactly what the Iron Man thing is supposed to counter. Guess procrastination won out in this case.

So, how much blog would a masak write if a masak could write blog? Here's a list off the top of my head of the things I've been *thinking* of blogging about:

- The presentation I'm writing for the [Open Source Days in Copenhagen](http://www.opensourcedays.org/2010/node/267) this weekend. I'm really excited about it.
- The ["7 Wonders of the Ancient Grammar Engine"](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/upcoming-the-7-wonders-of-the-ancient-perl-6-grammar-engine) series. I've started on it, and I like what I have so far.
- More [E03 stuff](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/e03-the-modern-pragmatic-honest-version-with-corners-cut). Guess that's what I didn't blog about in the past 11 days.
- snarkyboojum++ and I have started toying with writing a [time-travelling debugger](http://github.com/masak/tardis). Yes, really.
- A lot of things are happening in Rakudo-land this month, after the successful ng merge. colomon++ especially shines like a bright star right now, bringing lots of tests back online each day.
- I'd like to get enums in Rakudo before this month's release. I've already done anon enums. Next up: named enums.
- I've been starting to think seriously about [u4x](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/pretending-that-envy-is-one-of-the-perl-virtues) lately. Partly because of other people's questions, partly because it seems the the time is ripe to start it.
- However, every time I have that thought I realize that [the book](http://github.com/perl6/book) is more important at the moment. I have some unimplemented ideas there as well.
- GGE is [very near](http://github.com/masak/gge/blob/master/STATUS) being PGE-compliant. Just a few finishing touches are needed. This will likely usher in a [new era in Perl 6 grammars and parsing](http://github.com/masak/gge/blob/master/docs/COOLTHINGS).

 Will I have time in the near future to expand these one-liners into full-fledged blog posts? Only time will tell.

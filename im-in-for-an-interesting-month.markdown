Let me just itemize why for you.

- Last November I [blogged every day](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/that-was-the-month-that-was) for a month because, well, I helped create a wiki engine in Perl 6 with the same name as that month. It was a lot of work and a lot of fun, and now it's one year later and I seem to have forgotten, conveniently, how much work it was. So I've decided to do it again. Stand by for [another plan](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/a-full-month-of-november).
- I'll be [release manager](http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/raw/master/docs/release_guide.pod) for Rakudo on the 19th. (I did a practice dry run this month just to be sure it wasn't very difficult. It wasn't very difficult.)
- On that same day right after releasing Rakudo, I'll be boarding a plane, and departing for Eastern Europe, where I will partake in [eastern-European Perl-related activities](http://event.perl.lv/baltic2009/). jnthn++ will be there too. If you happen to be near Riga at the time, you should come too.
- Oh, and I keep hearing rumors that pmichaud++ and jnthn++ plan to rip Rakudo apart and put it together with the new [alien nqp-rx technology](http://github.com/perl6/nqp-rx) that pmichaud has been building lately instead of sleeping. So, biggest refactor evar, or something.

No need to curse ourselves with "May we live in interesting times", it seems. 哈哈

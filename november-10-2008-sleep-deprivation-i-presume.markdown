137 years ago today, Henry Morton Stanley, who had been sent to find [Dr David Livingstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Livingstone) by the New York Herald newspaper two years earlier, found him in the [town of Ujiji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujiji) on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. [Wikiquote](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Livingstone) notes this about the encounter, in which Stanley uttered the now famous "Dr Livingstone, I presume?":

<blockquote><div><p>There were no other white men known to be in the vicinity. As the two had not been formally introduced, it was a proper way to address Livingstone without committing a breach of etiquette.</p></div></blockquote>

This is yet another day when Real World tasks get the better of me. It's a temporary situation, but right now studies take all my time. I'd feel worse about it if the subject (Chinese security politics) wasn't so interesting. :) No, really, it is.

Also, having finally reset my sleeping to make it occur at night, I'm in great need of a bit of buffering sleep.

Anyway, this keyboard curfew gives me a lot of ideas, and hopefully makes me more focused on improvements. I'll be back tomorrow with the regularly scheduled revolutionary Perl 6 programming.

Today at the YAPC::EU keynote, the inimitable Larry Wall, accompanied by his guardian angel and his guardian devil, made a poll asking which ones in the audience believed Perl 5 and Perl 6 are the same language, and which ones believed they are two different languages.

I was in the front row, so I didn't see the sea of hands and which way the poll tipped. But on my row, both Patrick Michaud and Jonathan Worthington voted "different". I was slightly surprised to find myself voting "different" as well. I'm the one who only last year wrote [this entry](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-perl-6-is-not-perl-meme) which seems to insist on a "same" vote, if only by criticizing those who take the opposite view.

I think that what's happened in the past year is that there's a bit more room in the "Perl" space. We're now talking of [two different languages in the Perl family](http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/-5-v-6.html), and the Perl community being [shaped like a tuning-fork](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-wish-the-tuning-fork-and-the-one-true-heir) with its Perl-5 people, Perl-6 people, and Perl-omnivore people. It simply feels safer now to state "different", in a way it didn't last year.

One thing about the tuning fork that I really like is that it's basically two universes in one. We could've had

<dl>
<dd>(a) Perl 6 taking off early and essentially killing Perl 5, precluding its renaissance as Modern Perl, or</dd>
<dd>(b) Perl 6 floundering so badly and for so long that Perl 5 took over with such force that no-one bothered to develop Perl 6 anymore, and a "Forever Five" condition in the community was announced.</dd>
</dl>

Instead we find ourselves in a junctional universe where both languages are thriving and evolving. And they're different, not least because Perl 5 is older, more mature, and more used in business-oriented environments. But Perl 6 is getting there too, and the two languages will start playing together on increasingly equal footing, just like half-a-generation-apart siblings would.

I like that.

Now that we have the mechanical underpinnings for connecting rooms the way we
want, let's [connect all the
rooms](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/262cd871708df58ea91b3c81b828fb050e59a255)
in the entire dungeon. The game is not really this simple, but being able to
walk between all the rooms will serve us well today.

Oh, and the CLI should really [announce the
rooms](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/e478ae2393329b113606eea037562ddce66e15fd)
as we enter them, so that we know where we are.

Does it work? Well, have a look for yourself:

    CRYPT
    =====

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    > walk east
    Hill

    > walk in
    Chamber

    > walk south
    Hall

    > walk down
    Cave

    > walk northwest
    Crypt

    > walk southeast
    Cannot walk southeast because there is no exit there.

    > quit

So we can walk all the way into the dungeon... but when we try to turn around
and go back, we get a disappointing "no exit there" error.

Why? Well, we haven't made room connections bidirectional yet. [Let's do
that](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/9a7f528d5b92e1659cfa32c12f43a9b21581a6cf).

Now we can walk into the crypt, and then back out again.

    $ bin/crypt
    CRYPT
    =====

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    > walk east
    Hill

    > walk in
    Chamber

    > walk south
    Hall

    > walk down
    Cave

    > walk northwest
    Crypt

    > walk southeast
    Cave

    > walk up
    Hall

    > walk north
    Chamber

    > walk out
    Hill

    > quit

But I'm getting tired far too fast of having to write `walk` all the time. So
we [allow an abbreviated
way](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a9c83c02de04f9604e4eb7a5dead4e5c5e148b7d)
to write this. More abbreviations to come, of course.

    CRYPT

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    > east
    Hill

    > west
    Clearing

    > quit

It works. Nice.

Finally, we make the adventure engine [automatically `look` at new
rooms](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/8896863e9baa0130977bad88c65106e58dd95cef)
(whether we walk into them or are transported there). And then we make the CLI
[print descriptions when we
look](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/1c7f6e2f38bba5261ecba4d3e6f9be50b1106088).
(Only when doing this last commit did I notice that I had accidentally removed
the `look` command earlier in the commit history. Well, now it works again, and
without a special case.) We also add in all the room descriptions from last year.

    $ bin/crypt
    CRYPT

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
    patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

    > east
    Hill

    A flat, broad hill interrupts the dense-ish forest here. Only grass and
    small bushes grow on the hill.

    > in
    Chamber

    This is a cramped space just inside the hidden opening in the hill. The
    sun gets in enough to illuminate the place. There are some scribblings on
    the wall.

    > south
    Hall

    It's hard to believe that this kind of room can fit under a hill. It's tall,
    long, and quite spacious. Hieroglyphs adorn all four of the walls. The
    floor slants a bit.

    > down
    Cave

    This is a perfectly cylindrical chamber. An oversized fire-pit takes up most
    of the floor space in the middle of the room. Ancient runes run along the
    circumference of the wall. It's hot and stuffy.

    > northwest
    Crypt

    The air is stale and smells a bit metallic. Three impenetrable sarcophagi
    sit next to each other on the floor. On the walls are numerous finely
    inscribed ideograms.

    > quit

So, it's all starting to look like an adventure game. We can walk around and
look at stuff.

Tomorrow we'll add save/restore functionality to the game. This is wonderfully
easy because we're basing our whole design on serializable events.

Summarizing [pmichaud](http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/38134):

- There's this [competition](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/games/default.mspx) where you can solve problems using a variety of scripting languages.
- Why not solve them in Perl 6?
- Start by [getting a copy](http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/README) of Rakudo Perl 6. (You've always wanted this anyway — now's the time.)
- Rakudo has [improved](http://twitter.com/rakudoperl) amazingly lately!
- Questions? Ask at #perl6 or perl6-users.

Now go write those crazy script solutions!

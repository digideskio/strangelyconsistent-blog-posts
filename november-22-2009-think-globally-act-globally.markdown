27 years ago today, a 10-year old girl read the news, asked a question, and [changed the course of the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith). The Wikipedia article has the story, which is in some sense larger than life, with a fairy tale beginning and a sad, blunt ending:

<div class='quote'><p>During this period, large anti-nuclear protests were taking place across Europe and North America, while the November 20, 1983, screening of ABC's post-nuclear war dramatization The Day After became one of the most anticipated media events of the decade.</p><p>In this atmosphere, on November 22, 1982, Time magazine published an issue with [then Soviet's General Secretary] Andropov on the cover. When [Samantha] Smith viewed the edition, she asked her mother, "If people are so afraid of him, why doesn't someone write a letter asking whether he wants to have a war or not?" Her mother replied, "Why don't you?"</p></div>

She wrote the letter, Andropov answered, and in the reply was an invitation to Russia. The correspondance is too long to reproduce here, but not too long to [go and read on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith#Life). Bottom line, the General Secretary invited her to Soviet Russia, and she went there, as a sort of ambassador. She became a media phenomenon, both in the US and in Soviet Russia.

She died three years later in a tragic plane crash. She [has her own stamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USSR_stamp_S.Smith_1985_5k.jpg).

Today I asked jnthn++ what to do if I wanted to help with the `ng` branch. He suggested I put in `&open`.

I found that `t/spec/S16-filehandles/io.t` would probably be a good file to make pass, since it contained a lot of `&open` tests. So I ran it.

It didn't parse. `!~~` was missing. This is the only standard operator which *shouldn't* be added automatically by the `!` metaoperator, because it doesn't do the boolean negation of `~~`. Where the latter calls `ACCEPTS`, the former calls another method, `REJECTS`. I [put in `!~~` ](http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/218aee648a0742ba690ad6eabcad7dcc0cffafec) in `ng`.

The test file, which had now started running, failed on not finding the `.pick` method on `Range`. I started to put it back in `Any-list.pm`, where it had been in `master`. It contained features which are not implemented in `ng` yet, such as binding and `gather`. I wrote limited workarounds.

While I was in `Any-list.pm`, I noticed a misplaced `.perl` method, which should really be in `List.pm`. I [moved it](http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/44092124a13e614f01fe4b5a22da411f44509a1c).

Before I committed my `.pick` implementation, I was foolish enough to run it. Doing that revealed that `Range` doesn't have a `.list` method implemented. Well, I can do that, I thought. So I did.

But when I tried running *that*, it failed because it uses `&push`, which isn't implemented either. The `.pick` implementation I had written also uses `&push`, in the code which workarounds the lack of `gather`. I was informed that putting in `&push` would be non-trivial in some ways.

At this point, I [called it a night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep). Now I better understand what jnthn++ means when he's saying that trying to put in one thing in `ng` usually leads to having to put in a bunch of things. It's very true. But it was also really fun to help, in a small way. I will likely do it again soon.

Things I will remember from the trip to Paris:

* Sleeplessly hacking away at presentation software at night at Liz and
  Wendy's place. (This was after a fantastic pancake dinner and a set of
  competitive games of Martian Fluxx, most of which were won by Liz.) At about
  2 o'clock I managed to get the "viewport" in the presentation to pan over
  from one slide to another, and then discovered that it all looked smoother
  when a sine function was applied to the "reaction coordinate". (<i>(sin(πx -
  π/2)+1)/2</i> maps [0,1] to [0,1].) I the found that it looked even nicer
  when the sine function was applied twice.

* Giving my ["Hardcore bug
  reporting"](http://github.com/masak/osdc-fr-2010-hardcore-bug-reporting) talk
  and enjoying doing so. I believe I will give this talk again in some form
  or other.

* Paris (or at least [the part we were in](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=cite+de+science+et+de+l'industrie,+paris,+france))
  being unexpectedly derelict. No complaints about the venue, the hotel, the
  people, or the food, which were all excellent. Just the city itself being
  ugly beyond my wildest dreams.

* jnthn and mberends sleeping very soundly after an active first day while
  I sat cross-legged on my hotel bed, debugging presentation software and
  franticly writing slides for my other talk. (Incidentally, I hear there's
  a way to actually finish making the slides before the day you're supposed
  to give the talk. It's called "using slides from a previous conference",
  and I don't do that nearly enough.)

* Giving my other talk, "Perl 6: there's some madness to the method after
  all". I feared I might have too few slides, but instead I ran out of time
  and had to rush things a bit towards the end. This second talk didn't feel
  like a big splash, but might still have a few ideas in it that could be
  polished into something good. I kinda like the 'badges' idea.

* French jumping back into my head, annoying me with the readiness by which
  my brain could parse it compared to its almost non-existent ability to
  produce it. As a small consolation, by the time we handed Liz back to
  Wendy, we seemed to have managed to corrupt the former into speaking
  English with a heavy lolspeak accent, almost to the same extent as jnthn,
  mberends and I.

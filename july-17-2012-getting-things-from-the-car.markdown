Having created enough of the game engine, I now have a very pleasant DSL-like
thing in which to write crypt. Today in my commits I could write

    .place_thing('car', 'clearing');

And then

    .place_thing('flashlight', 'contents:car');
    .place_thing('rope', 'contents:car');
    .make_thing_openable('car');

This is much nicer than last year. And more flexible, as I hoped.

I found that in last year's game, I can examine the flashlight (which is in the
car), even without opening the car and revealing the flashlight. Now, you might
say, maybe the car has windows, but that wasn't the intent. I consider it a
bug, caused by hard-to-follow placement logic. Let's do better this year.

* We [put a car in the
  clearing](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/4eab8bbaf4e2163845c9800d7f7a4656b92e6174).
  Bam! Ain't that cute?

* In relation to this, I [discovered and fixed a
  bug](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/fd3ee8ce59c858f6ef3972741997a38a3c20d967)
  having to do with programmer (my) confusion about when events are applied. Some tests
  failed because the game reported the things from the *last* room when walking from one
  room to another. Yes, this happens because of my factoring with events. I'm not
  completely used to it yet, it seems. Anyway, thank you, extensive test suite.

* Now we put the flashlight and the rope in the car, and make them [be revealed when
  we open it](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/fd3ee8ce59c858f6ef3972741997a38a3c20d967).

* I make sure that a `look` command [reveals the insides of
  things](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/ae59ad95036c014d42b1539d0283eb1d18356b46),
  for example the car.

* Then I make sure `examine` [works from the
  CLI](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/37e0d351574801f1c95a54aab50602aca02f6238),
  and that when you open things, the CLI [says what, if anything, is
  inside](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/afd7967d5792f7fae0e3705594bf4198e98ea525).

That's it for today. So what does the game look like now?

    $ bin/crypt 
    CRYPT
    =====

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
    patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.
    You can go east.

    > examine car
    Small, kind of old, and beginning to rust. But it still gets you places.

    > examine flashlight
    You see no flashlight here.

    > open car
    Opening the car reveals a flashlight and a rope.

    > examine flashlight
    You see no flashlight here.

    > take flashlight
    Sorry, I did not understand that.

    > quit

Well, we're not repeating last year's error, for sure. But the last two
responses are wrong. Also, the car should appear in the description of the
room. Let's fix all those things tomorrow.

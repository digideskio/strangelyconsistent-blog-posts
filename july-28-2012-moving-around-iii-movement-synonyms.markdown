The game is finished. Now we're making it better. There's a lot of things to
make better.

Like,

* The [help
  text](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/dc328199a2a1cb6aefc3c3ae039b4b68b052378d).
* Writing [`n` instead of
  `north`](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/8325b8e6b8fddeff21b0d8059c13d81e30b9490c),
  optionally with `go` or `walk` before it. That was today's task, as far as I can tell.
  A disproportionately small one.

Oh, and just playing the game for a while, I noticed that I couldn't examine
things once I had taken them. So I [fixed
that](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/b8f270b6bab68a8332568b9f90250ba3c09e7dfa).
Speaking of which,

* There's now an [inventory
  command](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/8d2d80880bc73bf110accc9cebccf89bed20d74f).

Ah, it's fun to be playing the game again.

    $ bin/crypt 
    CRYPT
    =====

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
    patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.
    There is a car here.
    You can go east.

    > inventory
    You are empty-handed.

    > open car
    You open the car.
    Opening the car reveals a flashlight and a rope.

    > take flashlight
    You take the flashlight.

    > take rope
    You take the rope.

    > inventory
    You are carrying:
    A flashlight.
    A rope.

    > quit

    Thanks for playing.

There's still a few days left. I need as many people as possible to get in
there, play the game, and flush things out that are wrong or could be improved.
So if you have a few minutes, give the game a whirl. I'll do my best to fix
things quickly.

I'm sure there are bugs in there. [Help me find them](http://github.com/masak/crypt/)!

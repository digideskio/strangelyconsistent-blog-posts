Just writing in to say that I'm too tired to blog today about the progress today, due to all the progress today.

Tomorrow I'll put together a summary of the last "week" of Web.pm. Who knows, I might even be coherent by then.

In the meantime, for those of you who bothered to read all three paragraphs of a post called "No update today", here's what I currently have as [my desktop background](http://redballoon.tumblr.com/post/68179964/ffffound-creepy). I just can't stop analyzing that picture, it's mesmerizing.

Sometimes things seem to click and fall into place inside my brain. Previously
unrelated concepts turn out to be have commonalities after all.

For example, I said yesterday on #perl6 that I'd realized, teaching Perl 5,
that taking away `wantarray` was only a logical next step after taking away
sigil variance. Moritz was way ahead of me, though: he had [blogged about
exactly
this](http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/immutable-sigils-and-context.html)
a year ago.

But a much deeper insight hit me on the Sunday, when jnthn++ was talking, and
explaining how `Capture`s and `Signature`s form two sides of a function call
binding:

     caller                     callee
    
    Capture <---> binder <---> Signature

and then showing a slide that looked like this:

    my ($some, $random, $things) := some-function();

The point of the slide is that `Signature`s aren't just used in function
declarations; they're used in the above case as well. I've always thought that
this was a random, fortuitous bonus use of it...

...but then Liz turned to me and whispered "that's because `return` is just
another function call". And right then and there, I went through some sort of
mini-enlightenment. How beautiful!

Later, Liz divulged that this was the kind of insight that came naturally when
one had programmed in [continuation-passing style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)
for a while. It'd be interesting to learn whether CPS is the reason for
`Signature`s being used in bindings like this in Perl 6. For some reason, my
guess is no.

Anyway, Perl 6 surprising me with its consistency is only appropriate,
given the name of this blog.

*My trip to Moscow was a pleasant one,<br>
The city has [a certain feel](http://www.munnecke.com/islands/qwan.htm) I like.<br>
 [The metro](http://engl.mosmetro.ru/flash/scheme01.html) is so big and full of win!<br>
 And so too was [the room](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2010-05-16#i_2336857) at my hotel.*

*[My talk](http://masak.org/carl/devconf-2010/talk.pdf) was well-received and fun to give,<br>
 on Yapsi, Tardis, Sigmund and Perl 6.<br>
 [sharifulin](http://twitter.com/sharifulin)++ for speedy help<br>
 with [setting up his laptop](http://twitpic.com/1ol9ms) for my talk.*

*The guys at [Moscow.pm](http://moscow.pm.org/) made me feel<br>
 at home in Moscow, and enjoy my stay.<br>
 I only wish [my Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) wasn't crap.<br>
 Incentive to learn more of it, I guess.*

*At [Airport Sheremetyevo](http://www.svo.aero/en/) they said<br>
 "departure is tomorrow, not today".<br>
 'Pro tip': when booking, check an extra time<br>
 that chosen dates are actually correct.*

I tried to write iambicly above... That Shakespeare guy was pretty good, it seems! I'm not, so my attempts don't even rhyme. But maybe some commenters' comments will...?

Short post today. (Blogging daily makes a fellow want to cut corners.) More next time.

I'm halfway through writing [a tutorial](http://github.com/masak/web/tree/master/tutorial/) for Web.pm. It'll contain prime examples of all the components covered by the grant (CORE, Astaire, Squerl, Hitomi).

Also, there's a new user on #perl6, Wolfman2000++, who have taken on the role as (his own words) 'guinea pig' for Web.pm. I think that's really good news; early adopters are what's needed right now. And it also gives me a concrete target reader for the tutorial.

I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.

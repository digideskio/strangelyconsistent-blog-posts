Many small commits went in today. First, I decided to fix the things that were
missing from yesterday:

* You can [take the rope and
  flashlight](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/9f3040392660ebf6cff869db5a1c9a54155c30c8)
  from the car.
* But [not without opening the
  car](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a309abbc97c17956f8466c6bbbb69d8d19bd4aad)
  first. Happy path, sad path, see?
* Also, you can [examine things in the
  car](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/4c6b7f1d52b17cb0b633fe56660ef91c68cf684c).
* `look` [includes the things in the
  room](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/b10aab3cfbaa975a0d3fab63c0dc5c1295b111a3).
  Bit of a temp solution, and some duplication, but works for now.
* When you take something, [the game says you take
  it](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/42c3cf2bc1b712b4276b6a30e44b56edeaba6f96).
* Added [a quit
  message](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/21ccca88c2fe412957f027a7869c13da29a3ff5d),
  just like last year.

Therefore, now it looks like this:

    $ bin/crypt 
    CRYPT
    =====

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
    patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.
    There is a car here.
    You can go east.

    > examine car
    Small, kind of old, and beginning to rust. But it still gets you places.

    > examine flashlight
    You see no flashlight here.

    > open car
    Opening the car reveals a flashlight and a rope.

    > examine flashlight
    The flashlight, a trusty Flexmann 520, has been serving you for countless
    adventures.

    > take flashlight
    You take the flashlight.

    > quit
    Thanks for playing.

The only small detail that's wrong now is that there should be a "custom
description" for the car, and the game should really say "Your car is parked
here." I have a plan for how to fix this. But not today. All in due time.

Now, what I *really* meant to do today was this:

* You can [open the door on the
  hill](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/50aeeb08534b73d37ffc12ba0fe6ce78b40887cc).
* But not without [first examining the
  grass](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/bb4788a700be527003a6223e6628793256c5d887)
  where the door is hidden.
* Or, as it happens, [the
  bushes](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/a2c7c9e5c574102eeabfae41b5c288b46aa188d4).
* Then, let's [open the door and walk
  through](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/dcd529a43f048194854113291357a99e38ca9326).
* But walking south is only supposed to work [if you open the door
  first](https://github.com/masak/crypt/commit/27722eec71fb8f5528f41aeb6e4809760c151792),
  silly.

Implementing this game is great; today more than previous days I'm feeling just
how great. The foundation I've built in the first part of the month is not just
suitable for building adventure games, it's *perfect*.  It's fantastic. Look at
this:

    # Things on hill
    .place_thing('grass', 'hill');
    .make_thing_implicit('grass');
    .place_thing('bushes', 'hill');
    .make_thing_implicit('bushes');
    .place_thing('door', 'hill');
    .make_thing_openable('door');
    .hide_thing('door');
    .on_examine('grass', { .unhide_thing('door') });
    .on_examine('bushes', { .unhide_thing('door') });
    .on_open('door', { .connect(<hill chamber>, 'south') });

It's an adventure game world building API! (Yes, others will be able to take it
and run with it too, as long as I separate `Adventure::Engine` out into its own
module and publish it on [modules.perl6.org](http://modules.perl6.org)).

And not just that. The tests are wonderful, too!

    my $game = Crypt::Game.new();

    $game.open('car');
    is $game.examine('flashlight'),
        Adventure::PlayerExamined.new(
            :thing<flashlight>,
        ),
        'examining the flashlight in the car';

I'm very happy about how this is turning out. All programming should be like
this.

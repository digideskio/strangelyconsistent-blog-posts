*Alternative title: "novus november".*

I meant to write this post yesterday, but totally failed to take into consideration that I had planned in non-blogging frivolities for the whole day, and didn't have any access to the series of tubes.

So, I'm looking at [this post](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/a-full-month-of-november), from a year and a day ago. Here's a corresponding list of things that are on my mind for this month:

- Create some nice layouts for November. Specifically, lichtkind++ has been requesting one with a wider main column. I have an idea for a layout with minimalistic tendencies, such as the one on [Ryan Tomayko's site](http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git).
- Add features to November. (Notably, page diffs.)
- Make all the tests pass again in November. They've unfortunately bit-rotted some during the less active past few months.
- Expand the November nightly smokes to encompass all projects known to proto. Do things described in [this post](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/cheese-speleology).
- In order to do the above, give mberends++ a helping hand in making the `installed-modules` branch land.
- Join in the fun of helping jnthn++ and pmichaud++ move Rakudo over to [alien technology](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/im-in-for-an-interesting-month).
- Experiment with putting November on Web.pm.

All in all, this will help give November — as I put it in last year's plan — "a shove of enthusiasm". I think it'll be great fun.

There, that's... oh my! First post is today already! Gotta go mine Wikipedia a bit.

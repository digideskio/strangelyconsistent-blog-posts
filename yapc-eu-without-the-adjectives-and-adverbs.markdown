YAPC::EU 2009 deserves adjectives and adverbs. A lot of them. But I hear constraint liberates, so let's try a post without them.

* **The venue.** I liked it.

* **Andrew Shitov.** I would heap adjectives on him. That guy can arrange conferences. How does he do it? It impresses me. Andrew plus plus.

* **Giving talks.** Years pass, and the energy and nervousness I expend before and during talks keeps decreasing. I relaxed this time.

* **Listening to people's talks.** I liked doing that. I might have bias, but I preferred the ones about Perl 6. 哈哈

* **Hallway track.** It alone brought value to this conference. Discussion about the spec excels when the conversation takes place face to face.

* **Riga.** I must come to Riga in the future. It is a city I like. Its buildings have age and the food has tastes that I appreciate.

* **Esperanto guide.** She came from nowhere and she showed us town. Thank you, Esperanto guide.

* **Hotel Konventa Sēta.** Rooms, personel, location, everything. Full of wonder.

This blog lacks a commenting system; had it had one, I would have asked you to comment without adjectives and adverbs.

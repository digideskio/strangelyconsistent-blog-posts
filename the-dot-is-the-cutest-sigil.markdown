title: The dot is the cutest sigil

I've recently gotten into this style of programming:

    given %some-hash {
        if .<foo> {
            .<bar> = .<baz> + .<austria>;
        }
    }


I keep thinking of it as a wonky kind of sigil, the `.<>` sigil, which has its very own variable namespace inside of the hash I've chosen as topic.

Now let's say that the above piece of code was part of a prototyped program which later evolved to use objects instead of sloppy hashes. Then the same code becomes even nicer:

    given $some-object {
        if .foo {
            .bar = .baz + .austria;
        }
    }


The advantages of objects to hashes are immediate (and well-known):

- Less to write.
- The translation between the old style and the new is automatic. Just remove the pointy elbows.
- Spelling errors are now caught at runtime, as opposed to never.
- The reason assignments (like the assignment to `.bar` above) work is that attribute accessors can be made `rw`. The flip side of that is that one can omit the `rw` and avoid assignment accidents. That's also an improvement over the hash.
- Now the dot really looks like a cute little sigil. It isn't, of course, it's still the call-public-method twigil we know and love. But it's even easier to pretend that the attributes are special variables namespaced under the chosen object.

All this is fairly trivial; I just think it's a nice syntax. But it is with this example that the truth finally sinks in: *keeping `$_` and `self` separate from each other in Perl 6 was a really good idea*.

With the syntax Perl 6 settled on, it's like there are two topics in a method: the common one (`$_`), and the OO one (`self`). And each has wonderful shortcuts: with `$_` you just use `prefix:<.>` as above, and with `self`, you can use `$.` or `@.` or `%.` ad lib. The OO form is slightly longer than the common form, since OO is more intricate (and less ubiquitous).

    Long form     Short forms
    =========     ===========
    $_.foo        .foo
    
    self.foo      $.foo
                  @.foo
                  %.foo


And since they're disjunct from each other, you never have to context-switch or worry about what it is you're looking at when you see `.foo`. Unless you explicitly mix the two together with `given self` or invocant `$_` which you're entirely free to do, but remember that it only buys you one character.

As an added bonus, we can now re-write the code example in the [rejected rfc 342](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/rfc/342.html) so that it works in today's Perl 6, without introducing extra syntax:

    my $record = loadrecord($studentID);
    given $record {
        my $spam = open .minimum;
        $spam.say: qq:to'SPAM';
        Dear {.name}:
                Your tuition is now due.  Please send in a payment
        of at least {.minimum}.
        SPAM
    };

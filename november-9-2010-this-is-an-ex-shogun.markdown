143 years ago today, the Tokugawa Shogunate <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration#End_of_the_Shogunate'>ended</a>.

<div class="quote"> the 15th Tokugawa Shogun "put his prerogatives at the Emperor's disposal" and resigned 10 days later. This was effectively the "restoration" (<i>Taisei Hōkan</i>) of imperial rule - although Yoshinobu still was of significant influence.</div>

I wanted to know a bit more about <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Yoshinobu'>this Toku guy</a>.

<div class="quote">Tokugawa Yoshinobu (徳川 慶喜) (also known as Keiki), October 28, 1837–November 22, 1913) was the 15th and last shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan. He was part of a movement which aimed to reform the aging shogunate, but was ultimately unsuccessful. After resigning in late 1867, he went into retirement, and largely avoided the public eye for the rest of his life.</div>

At this point, I realized I hardly knew what a [shogun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun) is.

<div class="quote">Shogun (将軍 shōgun) (literally, "a commander of a force") is a military rank and historical title for (in most cases) hereditary military dictator of Japan. The modern rank is equivalent to a Generalissimo. Although the original meaning of "shogun" is simply "a general", as a title, it is used as the short form of seii taishōgun 征夷大将軍, the governing individual at various times in the history of Japan, ending when Tokugawa Yoshinobu relinquished the office to the Meiji Emperor in 1867.</div>

So there you have it. I'm a little curious as to *why* Toku resigned, and the answer seems to be somewhere in all those history articles; but my background in Japanese history is too bad to separate signal from noise.

I couldn't focus on anything substantial to do today, so I [found the undef warning](https://github.com/masak/druid/commit/13bf2abee90a9f1cbb7a57ba626ce7763b5917a4) in Druid, and then [fixed a test failure](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4d33bae5919d08bcf2347b0e5a1e3eb49c67e426) I'd accidentally introduced into the `.trans` method the other day.

Oh, and yesterday when I was fixing up Druid, I noticed that Rakudo had regressed on `&elems` (the sub form, not the method form). So today I [added it back](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e6486e55d334f3400d919db72f50d5f51459d459).

That sums up my activity for the day. Nothing big, just a lot of nibbling here and there.

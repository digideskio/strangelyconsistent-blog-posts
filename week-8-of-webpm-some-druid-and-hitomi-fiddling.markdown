Yet another week of distraction, it turns out. Also, it's late when I start putting this post together, so I'll be brief. For once.

- I have made some insignificant work on the Druid web app. I believe that this one is low-hanging fruit, because we already have an SVG module (two, in fact), and putting it to work with drawing a board would be a nice use-case. I had a head-scratching half hour of trying to figure out why the SVG wouldn't show up in the browser. After explaining the problem to mberends++ and having him test it, though, everything just worked. Typical. :)
- Ilya unfortunately had to back out of the rest of his Web.pm grant work, due to pressing external circumstances. We'll miss him, but Tene++ and I will keep churning away on the Web.pm grant, mapping his remaining 9 weeks to fall after my 11. Stay tuned for weeks 12-20, with some heavy MVC framework action.
- Due to this, I'll need to read up on MVC frameworks a bit. Will probably post about that too in the next few weeks, parallel to the Web.pm updates.
- I finally sat down and wrote those [Hitomi tests](http://github.com/masak/web/commit/6918b4ee73ac2ca57302cadedf88c541ef56ec3a) I'd been planning to write. That in itself raised a number of new questions, which I hope to address when I start implementation/porting next week.

I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.

Not having access to time travel, it's nevertheless nice to sometimes meet
people who seem to be on similar life paths, but later or earlier on the track.

Last week I chanced upon a 14yo boy who spent his days with a laptop, but
only playing games and watching YouTube vieos about games. Somehow he hadn't
started into programming. So I decided to show him some stuff. I spent an
evening showing nice Perl 6 features, and we ended up talking about which
languages to look into.

On my way back home from vacation, I wrote him an email to summarize what we
had talked about. I thought I'd share it with you.

If you're wondering why I start out mentioning C++ and Pascal explicitly
&mdash; that does seem rather odd, doesn't it? &mdash; it's because he had
heard about them before and was wondering whether they were any good.

> The problem-solving languages are sometimes known as "scripting

> Nine lines of Perl code, and he gets the answer. That's highly useful.

> Today in 2012, the industrial languages are C# and Java. Many people
> learn these at school and then go out and use them in their
> professional life. They are a little bit boring but they are very
> wide-spread, and knowing at least one of them is useful in today's
> world. Programs will be longer and less elegant than in the
> problem-solving languages, but there is more demand for these
> languages. I find I often "think" in the shorter scripting languages
> and then just translate to these industrial ones. Also, learning C
> well pays off because then you better understand how a computer works,
> and you will write more efficient Java or C# for it. (C pointers are
> unnatural at first, and your programs *will* segfault, even though
> most OSes survive that nowadays. It's trading away safety for
> speed.)
> 
> Finally, the magical languages are the ones that change the way you
> think about computers and programming. The ones in the LISP family are
> magical languages. Common Lisp is more established (for a LISP) but
> Scheme is cleaner and more minimal. LISPs are written in themselves,
> which is way cool. They call this "metacircularity". Means you can
> change anything you want. Don't mind the people who joke about all the
> parentheses, they don't get it. Smalltalk is another magical language.

> reflective, which again means you can find and change anything.

> A few further points of possible interest:

> * JavaScript won't go away anytime soon. It is the language of the
> web. It's not perfect, but it's good enough. Learn it.
> 
> * Perl people like me don't always think highly of PHP, but the fact
> remains that a many web applications today run on it. And it's not so
> hard to learn. My advice is learn it, but also try and learn why Perl
> is a better long-term alternative. ☺
> 
> * Forth and Prolog are both candidates for the magical languages
> category. Maybe check them out. Languages in the APL family are
> bordering on magical, taking a "calculator approach" to solving
> problems. The modern APL languages are called J and K.
> 
> * It doesn't really matter if you pick up Python or Ruby or Perl. They
> are all very decent scripting languages. Syntax debates over whether
> curly braces or 'do' blocks or indentation are better are mostly a
> waste of time.
> 
> * It's completely OK to goof off for 10 years and just write whatever
> the heck you feel like. Get real programming experience. After 10
> years, you can start to think about *why* some things work better than
> others.
> 
> * Linux is generally a nicer programmer environment than Windows.
> 
> * Check out Rosetta Code for a nice-and-easy way to compare different
> languages and their solutions to problems. Also has a nice collection
> of problems. :)
> 
> * You will learn faster if you go online and talk with other
> programmers. IRC is nice for that. I'm always on irc.freenode.net if
> you need something. Find a community you like, learn from them, and
> learn to ask good questions so people will help you .

> Good luck!

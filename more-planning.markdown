Ok, it seems I was shaken off the wagon of daily blogging by the combined forces of traveling and preparing for talks. Anyone with even a modicum of foresight could probably have seen that coming. I didn't.

But let's look forwards. I'll resume blogging from where I stopped, and number the days sequentially just as if there were no interruption. Thus for the purposes of this blogging spree, June will extend a bit into July.

Here are my plans for the remaining ten days:

21\. nested data structures<br>
22\. sprintf and .fmt<br>
23\. map and grep<br>
24\. types<br>
25\. **four in a row**

26\. signatures<br>
27\. classes<br>
28\. roles<br>
29\. **adventure game I**<br>
30\. **adventure game II**

Let's do this. Again.

Let's look at a week two years ago in the perl6 RT queue. Who submitted bugs?

Seems I just managed to tie with Moritz++ there. Almost one ticket a day sounds about right from what I remember of my submit pace from that time. In total, there were 16 tickets in that week.

Ok, that was two years ago. What about one year ago? By this time, Rakudo had already picked up a bit of a reputation.

Dang, only five tickets that week. 哈哈

Still, a pretty typical week. 25 tickets all in all. We see a bit more variation in the names now. That's the new people.

Finally, let's look at last week:

These figures help express what I feel. I'm still submitting a fair amount of tickets — all of nine last week — and still they make up an ever-smaller proportion of the growing deluge of perl6 tickets on RT.

Or, put differently, all you other people finally caught up with me. I can no longer compete with the rest of you. 哈哈

It makes me proud and excited to disappear under the waves of other people's contributions. There's been both a slow buildup over the past two years, and a sudden spike thanks to Rakudo Star. Together, they help drown out my insistent, repeating splashes on RT.

Rakudobugs are love. There's a whole lotta love out there right now. ♥ This uptake is what we've been waiting for.

54 years ago today &mdash; and yes, we do seem to have a bit of a Communism theme going &mdash; then Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev said to a group of Western ambassadors "We will bury you!"

<div class="quote">In fact, it was somewhat distorted. The actual quote reads: <strong>"Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will dig you in"</strong> (Нравится вам или нет, но история на нашей стороне. Мы вас закопаем).</div>

Be that as it may, Google Translate doesn't suggest "dig you in", it says "bury".

Khrushchev appears to have been a hot-tempered Soviet leader. The kind of guy who sticks his chin out, [bangs his shoe on the table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-banging_incident) and [says "Kuzka's mother"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuzma's_mother) to president Nixon. A few years later, Khrushchev mentions the "bury you" comment.

<div class="quote">On August 24, 1963, Khrushchev himself remarked in his speech in Yugoslavia, "I once said, 'We will bury you,' and I got into trouble with it. Of course we will not bury you with a shovel. Your own working class will bury you," a reference to the Marxist saying, "The proletariat is the undertaker of capitalism", based on the concluding statement in Chapter 1 of the Communist Manifesto: "What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable".</div>

The contrast between "the victory of the proletariat" and the two silent revolutions from [yesterday](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-17-2010-suppression-and-regressions) and [day before yesterday](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-16-2010-the-polite-revolt), is nothing short of stark.

I also found [this lovely little Time article](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867329,00.html) about the "bury you" incident. It describes Krushchev working himself up into a rage and tramples around on several diplomatic feet.

<div class="quote"><p>His voice was scornful as he added: "But we, Mister Capitalists, we are beginning to understand your methods."</p>

<p>By this time, the diplomats—who, in turn, have come to understand Mister Khrushchev's methods—had already left the room.</p></div>

Didn't get started on a `.trans` patch today. `$WORK` got in the way, and before I knew it, it was time to cut a Rakudo release.

Right now I'm running the spectests one last time, taking the chance to write this blog post. It hasn't been very taxing to make the release this time either &mdash; especially not compared to last year, when [the clock was ticking](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-19-2009-a-feeling-of-power-a-feeling-of-release) &mdash; but I figure I should pace myself and save the `.trans` patch, or whatever, for tomorrow. Releasing Rakudo is definitely worth one day of November blogging.

I'll just add in passing that, a little over half-way through this Month of November, I'm having no trouble finding things to do every day. I expect to reach the end of the month feeling "what? no more November?" rather than "phew! finally over!".

Well, I'll probably feel a little bit of both. 哈哈 But my point is that there seems to be a lot to fill this month with. My main concern is that I might get "stuck" in any of my projects and devote too much time to that, to the detriment of the others.

And that's rather nice, as problems go. I'm glad I decided to do another month of November blogging.

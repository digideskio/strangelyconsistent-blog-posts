I broke my almost month-long blog silence with the announcement for the prize. The last post I made before that was about a JFDI attitude to coding, an attitude which I later regained in spades... to the detriment of my blogging, it seems.

So, world: since I still don't have time to tell you everything I've neglected to tell you, I've decided to throw tiny summaries at you, a bit like confetti. If you want, you can lift your arms and spin around while the twinkling multicoloured things go *frzzzzz!* and come to rest on your shoulders and in your hair. Or you could just stand there, looking slightly annoyed at me for throwing pieces of paper at you which you later have to remove one by one, the last one (inside a fold in your shirt) not being found until sometime early next week.

These items are *intentionally* too vague and uninformative, but they're very JFDI. ☺ Who knows, maybe I'll come around to fleshing them out into actual posts.

Here we go.

- November [won the prize](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-won-a-prize) for a Perl 6 wiki. Yay!
- I've created a [package manager](https://github.com/masak/proto) for projects written in Perl 6. mberends++ is helping me; writing it is great fun. [**Update:** and then things [got out of proportion](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38876).]
- I made a refactoring of Druid over a month ago of which I'm very proud. I believe it contains valuable lessons about Perl 6 OO.
- I wrote the beginnings of an SVG emitter.
- Our [grant proposal for Web.pm](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2009/02/2009q1_grant_proposal_webpm_-.html) was [accepted](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2009/03/2009q1_grants_results.html), and I have started on the schedule to implement it. Will blog about that regularly, quoting passages from the Lolcat Bible along the way. [**Update:** [Week 1](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38619), [Week 2](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38651), [Week 3](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38695), [Week 4](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38800), [Week 5](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38871).]
- wayland++ has picked up the work with filling in the gaps of [what used to be S29](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-care-and-feeding-of-s29). I'm very happy about that.
- The u4x project is taking tiny steps forward. I've made some plans for the initial prototype.
- For a long time now, I've been meaning to review mberends++' work on the Pod parser, currently in perl6-examples. [**Update:** [I did that](http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/38644).]
- Traversing the AST of a Perl 6 program from inside Perl 6 is, like, awesome.

*Frzzzzz!*

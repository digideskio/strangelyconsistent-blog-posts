This post is the closing bracket to [that post](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/a-full-month-of-november).

For one month, I posted every seventh or eighth entry on use.perl, on average. It was a lot of work, but it was fun. It helped November forward quite a bit, too. (No, I won't write "November the wiki" when there's no risk of confusion. ☺) After doing that, I took a few days' vacation. Now I'm back to blogging, but at a less hectic pace; maybe semi-weekly or so.

I have a Perl 6 trick that I want to write about, but that'll have to wait until tomorrow. Today I'll just write this month summary: what historical event I wrote about on each day, what I did that day, and what I did overall compared to what [I said I'd do](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/a-full-month-of-november) in the beginning.

Every day, I surfed to Wikipedia to find some historical event that happened on that day, and which captured my interest. Here are the themes that apparently interest me:

30.  [soccer](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-30-2008-improvements) 

(I can't help noticing how *Western* this list of events is. This is the first time that a Wikipedia bias has really struck me — I think I'm going to partly counteract this by finding a few tens of notable non-Western events and adding them to the "events on this date" lists on Wikipedia.)

Here's what I did on the same days, in terms of November, Rakudo or Perl 6 improvements.

Finally, here are the things I promised I'd do, annotated with comments on what I've done:

- <dl>
<dt>Create three nice-looking layouts, which can all be used in p6w.</dt>
<dd>I created **one** really nice-looking layout for p5w, but I still haven't ported it to p6w. mpeters++ contributed a second layout.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Read a synopsis.</dt>
<dd>I've re-read and enjoyed S02, S04, and S09. Haven't blogged about it, though.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Give S29 some much-needed love.</dt>
<dd>Only started doing this, by writing about `.fmt` — plan to do a lot more.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Add or curate tests from the Perl test suite.</dt>
<dd>I've hardly touched the Perl 6 test suite. moritz++ for doing it a lot, though.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Implement a feature in Rakudo.</dt>
<dd>Not as many as I'd like, but a few.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Triage Rakudo tickets in the Perl RT system.</dt>
<dd>I've mostly just been creating them. ☺</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Implement MD5 digesting in Perl 6.</dt>
<dd>This remains a problem slightly above my programming ability. I've written the algorithm, but it doesn't produce the results it's supposed to. I'm stuck.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Add features to p6w that p5w already has. (article history, diffs)</dt>
<dd>Nope. Still a good idea, though. I'm surprised I didn't mention MediaWiki parsing among the features I was planning to implement, because that part of November is the real winner from the efforts of my one-month spree.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Blog about the architecture of November.</dt>
<dd>To some degree, yes. Can be done to a greater degree in the future.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Blog about cool things in Perl 6 and Rakudo.</dt>
<dd>Actually, I've only been blogging about bugs in Rakudo... but I hope I am able to communicate, through most of my posts, my feeling that Perl 6 is awesome. If not, I probably wouldn't keep doing what I'm doing.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
- <dl>
<dt>Add POD documentation to PIR subs and methods in Rakudo.</dt>
<dd>No. Still a great idea, though. The exact implementation of things may change, but good documentation is valuable.</dd>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>

Looking over those results, I'm both a bit proud of the things I did do, and eager to improve on the things I didn't. I guess that's the way it should be.

So, as part of my `$dayjob`, I was teaching a Perl course. Then this happened:

    * masak is teaching Perl 5 today! :)
    <Heather> masak teach me
    <masak> Heather: later; these people are paying me. :P
    [...]
    <masak> seriously though; if there were enough interest here on IRC, I
            would totally do a 1-day Perl 5 IRC workshop, pro bono.
    <masak> ditto a one-day Perl 6 IRC workshop.
    <vaelxon> (Perl 6 IRC workshop)++
    <masak> it'd be very awesome, I promise. I'd need some time to prepare.
            but then we can grab a channel and basically party/learn for a
            day together.

And that's now what's happening. It'll be a loose-knit group of us, joining up
in the `#masakism` IRC channel for four hours on May 1.

The course will be two-pronged; Perl 5 or Perl 6, whatever people prefer.

There will be prepared study material and exercises, but basically, people who
participate can go off on a tangent, just spend the four hours solving one of
the exercises really well, or solving a *different* exercise that they make up
themselves. People can focus on doing the exercises, or on discussing various
ways to solve them, or on discussing general principles of programming. Think
of the workshop as a hybrid of people writing/showing nice code, and people
discussing programming best practices.

Why am I doing this? Because as part of teaching Perl courses for `$dayjob`, I
realized how much I *love* teaching Perl. I literally spend those two course
days teaching Perl in a mild state of euphoria. I teach a lot of other courses,
and some of them are great to teach, but none of them are like Perl. I think
it's because I feel at home in the language, my brain has somehow "shaped
itself" around Perl, and the questions I get can often be answered with a
happy "let's find out!" where (a) we do some quick experiment in a terminal
window, and (b) I tend to know what we'll get before, so it's easy to explain.

The whipuptitude of Perl really works to one's advantage there. That, combined
with knowing my way around most of the `perldoc` pages and most of the special
variables. Oh, and I probably have a slight advantage being fairly deeply
involved in Perl 6 stuff, too.

As I write this, there are 13 participants signed up for the course. This is
already twice as big as the typical Perl course I teach in a corporate setting.
It's also a wide range of people; from relative newbies to people who could
probably give the workshop better than me. I expect people further up on the
learning curve to step in and assist with people further down. But I hardly
need to say that; this is Perl, and we're a helpful bunch.

including when, where, what, and how to sign up.

Things are moving forward. I'm enjoying myself within the Web.pm project, thinking of new ideas to try, and discussing a lot with other people. When looking at the milestones, it still feels like we're on track — though sometimes the "weeks" are slightly longer than seven days, due to the, er, intricacies of time allocation.

Anyway, this week was about 7 days long, and I used my 10 allocated hours for the following:

- Absorbed and toyed with suggested drafts for Hitomi, sent in by moritz++ and Tene++. (Reminder: "Hitomi" is an XML templater, tightly modeled after Python's Genshi.) Both these drafts uncovered new bugs in Rakudo, most of which subsequently were fixed.
- I like the grammar/actions approach arrived at in the latest iteration, but the thing is that actions, being fired in a bottom-up manner, are inadequate for a templater working top-down. I believe the actions should constitute a first pass over the template, building an abstract syntax tree whose nodes correspond to expression evaluations, for loops, and if statements. This tree can then be processed top-down. I've yet to see someone do this latter part. I don't believe it's difficult, just as-yet undone and therefore not entirely obvious.
- One thing I look forward to in Hitomi is writing it on top of the Parrot Compiler Toolkit — same platform as Rakudo is written on — because that'll mean that the PIR generated can be targetted especially for templates, and thus hopefully a bit faster. While [discussing](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-04-29#i_1103781) this with moritz, however, it became evident that there are backsides to tying Hitomi into a particular back-end. The [conclusion](http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-04-29#i_1103850) was that Hitomi will he a two-headed beast, one pure Perl 6 implementation and one PCT implementation. Both will run against the same test suite to keep things honest.
- Continued fixing deficiencies in November so that I can port it over to `Web::Request` and `Web::Response`. As `STD.pm` and Rakudo evolve, atrocities from the past keep haunting us. That is, we've written things like `Hash %properties` in parameter lists, thinking that meant "the hash `%properties`". Suddenly, when parameter checking gets a little stricter, it turns out that it really means "the hash of hashes `%properties`", and things fail. Live and learn.
- Similarly, there was a type check in the test that used `.WHAT eq` and broke when the return values of `.WHAT` suddenly changed. The `.WHAT eq` isn't Best Practices Perl 6 to begin with; it was a workaround becuase smartmatching didn't work in that particular case. The blocking bug had since been fixed, so I changed to smartmatching.
- All tests now pass in `master`, just as they should. I've set up a [nightly smoke](http://feather.perl6.nl/~masak/november-smoke.html), and I plan to expand this to both the bleeding Rakudo and the latest monthly release. That will give us excellent data for keeping November's `master` passing in the future.
- In a local branch, I finally started on the translation work of s/CGI/Web.pm/. It feels great, but also raises a number of questions that I'll have to discuss with Ilya when he gets back, since he wrote many of the underpinnings of November. I hope to have something substantial to show by the end of next week.

I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.

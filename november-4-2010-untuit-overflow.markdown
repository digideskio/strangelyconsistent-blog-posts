677 years ago today, the river [Arno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno) overflowed the city Florence in Italy. Florentine chronicler [Giovanni Villani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Villani) was there to report it.

...but there is no more information about the big flood in 1333. Only a general hint in the [Florence article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence):

<div class="quote">The River Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno — which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.</div>

There's a more recent flood, [in 1966](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_Flood_of_the_River_Arno), that's described in detail. But I can find no more than a general blurb about the flood in the 14th century. Even in Giovanni's source material, linked from his Wikipedia article, I draw a blank.

This will be kind of a non-post, because though today's explorations have given me reportable results, I'm too tired to sensibly summarize them. So that'll have to wait until tomorrow.

Suffice it to say, perhaps, that `psyde` is already benefitting from the improvements I promised to install [yesterday](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-3-2010-reform-and-improvement), and &mdash; if my suspicions are correct &mdash; will become even faster after some judicious tuning.

Good night.

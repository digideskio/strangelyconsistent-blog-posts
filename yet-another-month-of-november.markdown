Starting tomorrow &mdash; actually later today &mdash; I will make a
semi-short post each day. You have been warned.

Each such post will consist of two parts: one with a retrospective
into an event or phenomenon taking place on that particular day in November
sometime in history; the other with some modest update representing around
half an hour of work on something Perl 6-related. If this all sounds eerily
familiar, it might be because this is the third year I do this. It also
happens to be the last.

What do I pledge to do in the coming month? This:

- Make an effort to get November running again as a service on feather. (I might also get to tell the sad and mysterious story of how it stopped running.)
- Make November work under Rakudo `master`, as opposed to the `alpha` branch.
- Finish the last week of the Web.pm grant.
- Make Web.pm work under Rakudo `master`.
- Experiment with making November work with (parts of Web.pm).
- Work on Psyde, the static web engine that runs this blog.
- Investigate a common [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)-like markup converter that could serve both November and Psyde.
- Finish the module installer `pls`, such that it installs the whole ecosystem.

So that's it. Mostly my work will focus on November (hence the choice of month, after all), or on webby stuff.

Lately I feel I've lost contact with Actual Real Coding™, sort of sniffing at the outskirts of it, but not sitting down and practising it much. I see this as my chance to jump (or fall, or trip) back into the fray a bit. Looking forward to that.

Go go go!

I'm a bit extremely tired today. So I'll make this a quick one, because it's
really easy anyway.

Today we're implementing `save`/`restore` functionality, so saving in the
clearing and then restoring from somewhere else takes you back from the
clearing.

    $ bin/crypt 
    CRYPT
    =====

    You've heard there's supposed to be an ancient hidden crypt in these
    woods. One containing a priceless treasure. Well, there's only one way
    to find out...

    Clearing

    The forest road stops here, and the gaps between the trees widen into a
    patch of un-forest. The sky above is clear apart from a few harmless clouds.

    > save
    Game saved.

    > east
    Hill

    A flat, broad hill interrupts the dense-ish forest here. Only grass and
    small bushes grow on the hill.

    > in
    Chamber

    This is a cramped space just inside the hidden opening in the hill. The
    sun gets in enough to illuminate the place. There are some scribblings on
    the wall.

Saving and restoring is usually a pain in games, because you have to capture
all the game state and serialize it somehow. Since we're doing everything with
events, our job is easier. We just save all the events, put them somewhere, and
when we want to restore the game, we apply all the saved events on a fresh game
engine.

(I didn't choose to save to file here, so a save doesn't persist between
program runs. However, it's the principle I want to show here, and messing with
files would mostly just hide the interesting bits.)

It's *very* important in an adventure game that when you restore you're not
left with extra items or lingering state somehow. This cannot happen in our
factoring, because everything is flushed and re-created from the event stream.
The game is literally replayed behind the scenes to the point where you saved.

And there we are. Good night. `:-)`

I got it into my head to make a short-ish blog post every day during June, building up programming knowledge from the very basics into something that could be used for everyday programming.

The target audience: let's say a highschooler wanting to get into programming. Someone who doesn't care that it's called "conditional", but who will call it an if for a couple of years to come at least. But I imagine the posts might be enjoyable for other readers as well; not least those who want to get into Perl 6 but to whom the synopses are just too information-dense and imposing.

I plan to introduce one, sometimes two, concepts a day and just show what you can do with them. Every five days or so I will write a slightly longer piece of code pulling together those concepts. Most often into a game or other. (I owe much of my computer interest to [this book](http://www.amazon.com/BASIC-Computer-Games-Microcomputer-David/dp/0894800523/), which I perused with great interest during high school.)

I only have half a plan so far, but that's OK. It looks like this:

1. I/O (`say` and `prompt`)
1. variables
1. `if` statements
1. simple loops
1. **guess a number between 1 and 100**
1. string concatenation and `x`
1. arithmetic
1. `substr`
1. `given` statement
1. **moon lander**
1. arrays
1. `for` loops
1. `.push` et al
1. `.comb`
1. **chomp!**

Looking forward to a month of no-nonsense educational Perl 6 blogging!
